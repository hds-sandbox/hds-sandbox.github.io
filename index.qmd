### We are a collaborative project with team members spanning five Danish universities

The Health Data Science Sandbox is a national project coordinated by the [Center for Health Data Science](https://heads.ku.dk/) at the University of Copenhagen. We're working with a network of health data science experts to build training resources on academic supercomputers for students and researchers in Denmark. Our Sandbox contains [training modules](modules/index.qmd) that pair topical datasets with recommended analysis tools, pipelines, and learning materials/tutorials in a portable, containerized format.

### To get involved as a trainee, researcher, or educator in Denmark:

**TRAINEES**: [join](news.qmd) our next scheduled workshop or a supported university course

**TRAINEES/RESEARCHERS**: explore [training modules](modules/index.qmd) independently on UCloud

**RESEARCHERS**: adapt [training modules](modules/index.qmd) or [code repositories](https://github.com/hds-sandbox) to your research

**EDUCATORS**: [host](access/index.qmd) a training event or course in the Sandbox with our support


&nbsp;

:::{.callout-note title="A note on Sandbox data policy"}
The Sandbox aims to be a resource for learning new analysis approaches and tools for health data science on useful, interesting, and safe-to-share datasets. All person-specific datasets in the Sandbox are non-sensitive and GDPR-safe because they are 1) sourced from public databases, 2) fully anonymous/non-sensitive from a GDPR perspective, and/or 3) synthetic. To learn more, check out [Datasets](https://hds-sandbox.github.io/datasets/datapolicy.html) where we explain our data policy in detail and our approach to synthetic data generation.

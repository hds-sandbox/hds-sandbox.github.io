# Accessing the Sandbox on UCloud

User accounts on UCloud are enabled by university login credentials using WAYF (Where Are You From). Access the WAYF login portal [here](https://cloud.sdu.dk/), and then find your affiliated Danish university using the search bar. After login, we suggest setting up Two Factor Authentication by clicking on the icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

On UCloud, the Sandbox environment is deployed as apps linked to topical modules which can be loaded into your personal workspace. All new UCloud users are allocated a trial amount of computational resources which can be used to run one of the Sandbox apps. Extensive documentation on how to use apps and run jobs is available in the UCloud [user guide](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/).

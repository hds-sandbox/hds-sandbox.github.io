Health data science experts at five Danish universities are contributing to the Sandbox with coordination from the Center for Health Data Science under lead PI Professor Anders Krogh. Data scientists hosted in the research groups of each PI are building infrastructure and training modules on Computerome and UCloud, the primary academic high performance computing (HPC) platforms in Denmark. </p> <p></p> <p>Our computational 'sandbox' allows data scientists to explore datasets, tools and analysis pipelines in the same high performance computing environments where real research projects are conducted. Rather than a single, hefty environment, we're deploying modularized topical environments tailored for independent use on each HPC platform. We aim to support three key user groups based at Danish universities:</p> <ul> <li>trainees: use our training modules to learn analysis techniques with some guidance and guardrails - for your data type of interest AND for general good practices for HPC environments     </li> <li>researchers: prototype your tools and algorithms with an array of good quality datasets that are GDPR compliant and free to access</li> <li>educators: develop your next course with computational assignments in the HPC environment your students will use for their research</li> </ul> <p>Activity developing independent training modules and hosting workshops has centered on UCloud, while collaborative construction of a flexible Course Platform has been completed on Computerome for use by the Sandbox and independent educators. Publicly sourced datasets are being used in training modules on UCloud, while generation of synthetic data is an ongoing project at Computerome. Sandbox resources are under active construction, so check out our other pages for the current status on HPC Access, Datasets, and Modules. We run workshops using completed training modules on a regular basis and provide active support for Sandbox-hosted courses through a slack workspace. See our Contact page for more information.</p> <p></p> Partner with the Sandbox   The Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers and educators. We'd like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk.  <p>We thank the Novo Nordisk Foundation for funding support.

Computerome is located at the Technical University of Denmark (and co-owned by the University of Copenhagen) while UCloud is owned by the University of Southern Denmark. These HPC platforms each have their own strengths which we leverage in the Sandbox in different ways.</p> Computerome <p>Computerome is the home of many sensitive health datasets via collaborations between DTU, KU, Rigshospitalet, and other major health sector players in the Capital Region of Denmark. Computerome has recently launched their secure cloud platform, DELPHI, and in collaboration with the Sandbox has built a Course Platform on the same backbone such that courses and training can be conducted in the same environment as real research would be performed in the secure cloud. The Sandbox is supporting courses in the Course Platform, but it is also available for independent use by educators at Danish universities. Please see their website for more information on independent use and pricing, and contact us if you'd like to collaborate on hosting a course on Computerome. We can help with tool installation, environment testing, and user support (ranging from using the environment to course content if we have Sandbox staff with matching expertise).</p> <p>Participants in courses co-hosted by the Sandbox can check here for access instructions. </p> UCloud <p>UCloud is a relatively new HPC platform that can be accessed by students at Danish universities (via a WAYF university login). It has a user friendly graphical user interface that supports straightforward project, user, and resource management. UCloud provides access to many tools via selectable Apps matched with a range of flexible compute resources, and the Sandbox is deploying training modules in this form such that any UCloud user can easily access Sandbox materials independently. The Sandbox is also hosting workshops and training events on UCloud in conjunction with in-person training. </p> <p>Check out UCloud's extensive user docs here and instructions for how to access Sandbox apps here.</p>"},{"location":"access/Computerome.html","title":"Computerome","text":""},{"location":"access/Computerome.html#accessing-the-sandbox-on-computerome","title":"Accessing the Sandbox on Computerome","text":"<p>We do not currently support independent use of Sandbox materials on Computerome.

However, the discussion on this page is heavily weighted towards our interest in new school synthesis - with our connections to generative modeling researchers and high quality data, we are naturally interested in figuring out a safe way to deploy synthetic datasets derived from deep learning and other high similarity approaches.</p> The TLDR for synthetic data in the Sandbox <ul> <li>The development of synthetic datasets should be viewed as a research project. The technology is generally untested with few examples of public roll-out, and its deployment should be future-proofed as much as possible against attacks and potential sensitive data disclosure.</li> <li>Synthetic data generation and evaluation approaches should be tailored     to each dataset of interest. With current technology, it is unlikely that high quality, safe-to-share datasets will be produced at any kind of production scale without a massive effort devoted to pre-processing, data harmonization, and customized routines for different families of datasets.</li> <li>The Sandbox is not openly sharing any synthetic datasets generated from person-specific sensitive data. We think these datasets will be useful to approved researchers that ideally gain access via an approved data portal with registration and data use agreements with relevant data authorities. We are not currently that portal.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"datasets/synthdata.html#generating-synthetic-data","title":"Generating synthetic data","text":"<p>We have explored the performance of copulas, multiple imputation, sequential synthesis, and several generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches with a cancer dataset which we were developing for a course in the MS in Personal Medicine program at University of Copenhagen. We quickly discovered that factors such as missingness, collinearity, and the ratio of patients to features cause just as many problems for synthetic data generation as they do in predictive modeling. We are currently evaluating the above techniques as well as additional deep learning approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Bayesian graphs against a collection of benchmark health datasets to better understand the positives and negatives of each technique when faced with common challenges in real world health data.</p> <p>Recently, a few interesting libraries / pipelines have been released that enable testing of different synthetic data generation approaches alongside a range of evaluation metrics. We are actively exploring these tools as we test different generation approaches and examining their implementation of evaluation metrics. We plan to add additional components and features as we resolve challenges with different target datasets.</p>"},{"location":"datasets/synthdata.html#evaluating-synthetic-data","title":"Evaluating synthetic data","text":"<p>There are 3 key principles to consider when judging the overall quality of a synthetic dataset: fidelity to the original dataset, risk to privacy, and prediction utility. Fidelity and utility are often grouped together as similarity to the original data which exists in a trade-off with privacy - the more similar your synthetic dataset to the original, the higher your risk to patient privacy. However, the distinction between them is important as they can be achieved independently of each other depending on the project frame. Fidelity refers to reproduction of the multivariate shape and structure of the original data (including complex nonlinear relationships) while utility refers to how well the synthetic dataset matches the predictive accuracy of the original dataset. Risk to privacy includes both risk of patient reidentification and risk of sensitive information disclosure about a patient. There are many proposed evaluation metrics for measuring different aspects of these three qualities. We are actively investigating the performance of these metrics against our different datasets.</p> <p></p> <p>We should point out that while using quantitative metrics to assess privacy preservation is a critical step in creating a synthetic dataset, positive results do not absolve us from any concerns regarding risk to privacy in the synthetic data. Regulatory guidelines regarding the safety of synthetic data and the ability to openly share it are extremely unclear. No authorities have specified quantitative cut-offs using these metrics that enable open release, for example. For this reason, we have developed our own internal guidelines for how to handle this aspect of the project, which are based on a comprehensive examination of relevant EU and Danish legislation (i.e. the GDPR, the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Danish Health Law, and the Danish Data Protection Act). We continue work on synthesis with hope that new legislation such as the development of the European Health Data Space will provide further guidance in the future.   </p>"},{"location":"datasets/synthdata.html#rules-for-synthetic-data-in-the-sandbox","title":"Rules for synthetic data in the Sandbox","text":"<p>We are currently focused on exploring methods and metrics by developing reproducible, well documented examples and use cases of synthetic data in partnership with other researchers, legal advisors, and data authorities. We're relying primarily on publicly available tabular health datasets in this exploration phase, but we will also work with sensitive data in the future.  Our rules aim to preserve the trust of the public in how their health data is handled by data authorities and researchers. </p> <p>Sandbox Rules for Synthetic Data</p> <ol> <li>Creation of synthetic data involves processing sensitive data, and this requires obtaining project approvals from data authorities when performing this work on sensitive data. Any synthetic data work with restricted-access, sensitive data by the Sandbox will only be conducted with these approvals in place in the frame of a research project.</li> <li>Goals for each synthetic dataset project should be defined at project initiation: how will the synthetic dataset be used, who is the intended audience, and how might it be shared? This frame should govern every consequent decision for that dataset and be shared alongside the final dataset.</li> <li>Quantitative metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation should be implemented for each dataset and shared alongside the final dataset.</li> <li>A cost-benefit analysis should be performed after the project is completed - is any risk to privacy appropriately balanced by value of the dataset in achieving its stated aims and contributing to the public good?</li> <li>Data authorities with ethical and strategic stakes in who accesses the synthetic dataset should be included in decisions about how it is used and who is allowed to access it. </li> <li>Synthetic datasets created from person-specific sensitive data rather than population characteristics can still pose privacy risks, and any users of the dataset should be approved and registered. The Sandbox will not release any such datasets publicly and will instead work with appropriate data authorities to decide how such datasets should be governed in a responsible way. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"modules/index.html","title":"Modules","text":"<p>Sandbox resources have been organized as training modules focused on key topics in health data science.

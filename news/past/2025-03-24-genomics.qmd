The Sandbox Genomics course is an intensive four-day program focused on training participants in Population genetics with a focus on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The first day covers foundational genetics concepts through lectures and discussions, followed by a step-by-step guide to performing a GWAS study, from data preprocessing to results interpretation. A key feature is a hands-on GWAS case study where participants complete the entire process, including managing missing genotypes, conducting linear regression for association testing, and understanding linkage disequilibrium for fine-mapping. The course emphasizes practical skills, best practices, and common challenges in GWAS, especially when using high-performance computing.

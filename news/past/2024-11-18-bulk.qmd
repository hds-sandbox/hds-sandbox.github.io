This workshop contains a basic tutorial on how to approach bioinformatics analyses of bulk RNAseq data, starting from the count matrix.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Gain insight into how to design an RNA-seq experiment
- Preprocess sequencing reads
- Analyze bulk RNAseq data using the R package DESeq2
- Know best practices for performing Differential Expression Analysis
- Annotate and interpret their results

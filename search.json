Rather than instruct on the whys and wherefores of using particular tools for a bioinformatics analysis, we will cover the general process of building a robust pipeline (regardless of data type) using workflow languages, environment/package managers, optimized HPC resources, and FAIRly managed data and tools. On course completion, participants will be able to use this knowledge to design their own custom pipelines with tools appropriate for their individual analysis needs.\nThe course will provide guidance on how to automate data analysis using common workflow languages such as Snakemake or Nextflow. Subsequently, we will delve into ensuring the reproducibility of pipelines and explore available options. Participants will learn how to share their data analysis and software with the research community. We will also delve into different strategies for managing the produced research data. This includes addressing the challenges posed by large volumes of data and exploring computational approaches that aid in data organization, documentation, processing, analysis, storing, sharing, and preservation. These discussions will encompass the reasons behind the increasing popularity of Docker and other containers, along with demonstrations on how to effectively utilize package and environment managers like Conda to control the software environment within a workflow. Finally, participants will learn how to manage and optimize their pipeline projects on HPC platforms, using compute resources efficiently."

Check out upcoming events in the table below!\n\nUpcoming Sandbox Training Events\n\n{{ read_csv(‘../assets/upcomingcourses.csv’) }}\n\n\nNews & Updates\n\n\n07/11/2023 - Proteomics Sandbox Update: Enhanced Security and New Metabolomics Tools (U0niversity of Southern Denmark)\nThe Proteomics Sandbox Application has recently undergone a significant update, enhancing its security features to ensure safer usage for its users. In this latest iteration, the application has expanded its software suite by introducing two new tools: DIA-NN and MZmine, catering to the metabolomics field. Furthermore, the pre-existing software within the application has been refreshed and updated to the latest versions, ensuring that the Proteomics Sandbox Application remains at the cutting-edge of the field. Excitingly, this application will be actively utilized in the course “BMB831: Biostatistics in R II” at the University of Southern Denmark throughout this autumn, showcasing its relevance and applicability in academic settings.\n\n\n25/10/2023 - ‘Research Data Management for NGS Data’ with DeiC (Technical University of Denmark)\nSandbox data scientist Jose Alejandro Romero Herrera ran the first instance of a new module on research data management practices he developed specifically for NGS data. Twelve participants were hosted in conjunction with DeiC at DTU, and were exposed to tools like bash, conda, git, and cookie cutter in their quest to organize their omics data.\n\n\n07/09/2023 - ‘Digging into the Health Data Science Sandbox’ at the Danish Bioinformatics Conference 2023 (Aarhus University)\nThe full team of Sandbox data scientists hosted a 4 hour workshop at the Danish Bioinformatics conference where they gave a taster session of each of our 3 omics apps. We learned that multi-omics analysis were a substantial draw for the crowd at the DBC and are making plans to address this interest in future events.\n\n\n29/08/2023 - 3 days of Sandbox demos at Aarhus University\nSandbox data scientist Samuele Soraggi hosted a three day speed run through Sandbox apps at the Bioinformatics Research Center. The 26 participants joined for genomics, transcriptomics, and/or proteomics app demos depending on their interests. This thorough omics demo had maxed out participant sign-ups and an enthusiastic crew enjoyed the sessions alongside a bit of networking across disciplines. We plan to host more of these type of workshops given the event’s success!\n\n\n19/06/2023 - 3 days of bulk RNA-seq at the University of Copenhagen\nOur teaching team (from the Sandbox, the HeaDS DataLab, and reNEW’s genomics platform) hosted another 3 day workshop on bulk RNA-seq. The 34 participants used the updated version of the UCloud Transcriptomics App which provided the smoothest experience yet for both trainers and trainees. A new goal for the next course run is to add a student project to support independent implementation and exploration of the course content.\n\n\n31/05/2023 - Sandbox App updates on UCloud rolled out\nNew versions of the Genomics Sandbox App, the Transcriptomics Sandbox App, and the Proteomics Sandbox App have all been launched on UCloud this month! Check out the new components in the training modules such as a GWAS module in Genomics and new tools in Transcriptomics and Proteomics. Updates were also informed by the different courses supported during Spring 2023. With these courses wrapping up this month, the associated new training materials have also been included in the new versions of the apps.\n\n\n18/01/2023 - Second bulk RNA-seq course at the University of Copenhagen\nOn 18th of January we taught the second iteration of our bulk RNA-seq course to researchers (from PhD students to professors) at SUND at the University of Copenhagen. We had ~50 workshop participants joining us for three days of lectures and exercises on UCloud. This time, we introduced preprocessing theory (read QC, alignment and quantification) and the use of automated workflows using the nf-core rnaseq pipeline.\nFor those that could not enroll for this session, you can find the updated material here. We have moved the datasets and slides to a zenodo repository\nWe’d like to extend our thanks to our workshop collaborators, data scientists from the SUND DataLab at KU’s Center for Health Data Science as well as the genomics platform at the NNF Center for Stem Cell Medicine (reNEW).\n\n\n10/01/2023 - Sandbox support for Spring 2023 courses\n\nSandbox support for ‘Population Genomics’\nExercises for an MS course on Population Genomics taught by Prof. Kasper Munch at Aarhus University are being implemented on UCloud by Sandbox data scientist Samuele Soraggi. Students will explore the training materials on UCloud during the Spring 2023 semester, after which the materials will be accessible to any UCloud user via the Genomics Sandbox App.\n\n\n‘Fra real-world data til personlig medicin’ with Course Platform & Sandbox support\nThe second round of the course ‘Fra real-world data til personlig medicin’ in KU’s MS in Personlig Medicin begins in January with an introduction to CLL-TIM, a predictive model for chronic lymphocytic leukemia deployed by Prof. Carsten Niemann, an introduction by Sandbox coordinator Jennifer Bartell to the new Course Platform at Computerome built with Sandbox help for hosting courses with HPC resources, and an introduction to building predictive models using TidyModels in R by Prof. Rasmus Broendum. The course will run through April with 10 continuing education students building their own predictive models using a new and improved synthetic CLL dataset developed by Sandbox data scientist Sander Boisen Valentin. Jennifer and Rasmus are also manning the Sandbox Slack workspace to field student questions about the dataset and their model building.\n\n\nSandbox support for ‘Single-cell, Single-Molecule: The Next Level in Cell Biology’\nAn NNF-funded course, ‘Single-cell, Single-Molecule: The Next Level in Cell Biology’ combining experimental and computational approaches to RNA sequencing is starting at Aarhus University. In addition to course-responsible professor Stig Andersen and co-teachers Victoria Birkedal and Thomas Boesen, Sandbox PI Mikkel Schierup will be contributing along with Sandbox data scientist Samuele Soraggi. Samuele is adapting the Transcriptomics App material on UCloud to supply tutorials and exercises for this hefty course as well as serving as a teaching assistant. The course materials will be available to all users of the Transcriptomics Sandbox App on UCloud in the future.\n\n\n\n8/01/2023 - Soft launch of the new Course Platform at Computerome\nSandbox data scientist Jesper Roy Christiansen has been integral to the development of a new ‘Course Platform’ at Computerome, the HPC platform at the Technical University of Denmark. Built as a collaboration between the Sandbox and Computerome, the Course Platform will host its first users, students in ‘Fra real-world data til personlig medicin’, a course of KU’s MS in Personlig Medicin. Sandbox coordinator Jennifer Bartell and Sandbox PI Martin Boegsted have also been involved in testing this new system during course setup. See the above link as well as HPC Access for more details on this platform and how you can also use this new platform to host courses (with or without Sandbox involvement!).\n\n\n30/11/2022 - Sandbox support for ‘Advanced Statistical Learning’\nSandbox data scientist Samuele Soraggi spent two weeks teaching for the Fall 2023 course ‘Advanced Statistical Learning’ taught by Prof. Asger Hobolth at Aarhus University.\n\n\n15/11/2022 - Sandbox support for a workshop in the series ‘Workshops in Applied Bioinformatics’ at SDU\nSandbox data scientist Jacob Fredegaard Hansen created a tutorial on how to use ColabFold for a one day workshop as part of the ‘Workshops in Applied Bioinformatics’ series taught by Sandbox collaborator Veit Schwammle. The material is accessible on the Sandbox website (see Modules, Proteomics) for any UCloud user alongside the UCloud ColabFold App.\n\n\n10/12/2022 - Transcriptomics Sandbox app launched on UCloud!\nWe have deployed our second standalone Sandbox app on UCloud!

    "text": "It is necessary to clarify what we mean when we refer to synthetic data within the Sandbox project. While the term has been used for decades to describe all kinds of ‘non-real’ data including those derived from models and simulations, developments in deep generative modeling have dramatically expanded our understanding of what synthetic data can be. In the age of deepfakes and news articles written entirely by ChatGPT, synthetic data derived from deep learning is in a wholly different class from data simulated with a mechanistic or agent-based model.\nThe Sandbox is actually interested in any form of synthetic data - our highest priority is providing safe-to-use data to trainees and researchers that does not raise any concerns about sensitive data with respect to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and local Danish data regulations. So, we are using both old school and new school forms of data synthesis. However, the discussion on this page is heavily weighted towards our interest in new school synthesis - with our connections to generative modeling researchers and high quality data, we are naturally interested in figuring out a safe way to deploy synthetic datasets derived from deep learning and other high similarity approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TLDR for synthetic data in the Sandbox\n\n\n\n- The development of synthetic datasets should be viewed as a research project. The technology is generally untested with few examples of public roll-out, and its deployment should be future-proofed as much as possible against attacks and potential sensitive data disclosure.\n- Synthetic data generation and evaluation approaches should be tailored     to each dataset of interest. With current technology, it is unlikely that high quality, safe-to-share datasets will be produced at any kind of production scale without a massive effort devoted to pre-processing, data harmonization, and customized routines for different families of datasets.\n- The Sandbox is not openly sharing any synthetic datasets generated from person-specific sensitive data. We think these datasets will be useful to approved researchers that ideally gain access via an approved data portal with registration and data use agreements with relevant data authorities. We are not currently that portal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have explored the performance of copulas, multiple imputation, sequential synthesis, and several generative adversarial network (GAN) approaches with a cancer dataset which we were developing for a course in the MS in Personal Medicine program at University of Copenhagen. We quickly discovered that factors such as missingness, collinearity, and the ratio of patients to features cause just as many problems for synthetic data generation as they do in predictive modeling. We are currently evaluating the above techniques as well as additional deep learning approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and Bayesian graphs against a collection of benchmark health datasets to better understand the positives and negatives of each technique when faced with common challenges in real world health data.\nRecently, a few interesting libraries / pipelines have been released that enable testing of different synthetic data generation approaches alongside a range of evaluation metrics. We are actively exploring these tools as we test different generation approaches and examining their implementation of evaluation metrics. We plan to add additional components and features as we resolve challenges with different target datasets.\n\n\n\nThere are 3 key principles to consider when judging the overall quality of a synthetic dataset: fidelity to the original dataset, risk to privacy, and prediction utility. Fidelity and utility are often grouped together as similarity to the original data which exists in a trade-off with privacy - the more similar your synthetic dataset to the original, the higher your risk to patient privacy. However, the distinction between them is important as they can be achieved independently of each other depending on the project frame. Fidelity refers to reproduction of the multivariate shape and structure of the original data (including complex nonlinear relationships) while utility refers to how well the synthetic dataset matches the predictive accuracy of the original dataset. Risk to privacy includes both risk of patient reidentification and risk of sensitive information disclosure about a patient. There are many proposed evaluation metrics for measuring different aspects of these three qualities. We are actively investigating the performance of these metrics against our different datasets.\n\nWe should point out that while using quantitative metrics to assess privacy preservation is a critical step in creating a synthetic dataset, positive results do not absolve us from any concerns regarding risk to privacy in the synthetic data. Regulatory guidelines regarding the safety of synthetic data and the ability to openly share it are extremely unclear. No authorities have specified quantitative cut-offs using these metrics that enable open release, for example. For this reason, we have developed our own internal guidelines for how to handle this aspect of the project, which are based on a comprehensive examination of relevant EU and Danish legislation (i.e. the GDPR, the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Danish Health Law, and the Danish Data Protection Act). We continue work on synthesis with hope that new legislation such as the development of the European Health Data Space will provide further guidance in the future.\n\n\n\nWe are currently focused on exploring methods and metrics by developing reproducible, well documented examples and use cases of synthetic data in partnership with other researchers, legal advisors, and data authorities. We’re relying primarily on publicly available tabular health datasets in this exploration phase, but we will also work with sensitive data in the future. Our rules aim to preserve the trust of the public in how their health data is handled by data authorities and researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox Rules for Synthetic Data\n\n\n\n1. Creation of synthetic data involves processing sensitive data, and this requires obtaining project approvals from data authorities when performing this work on sensitive data. Any synthetic data work with restricted-access, sensitive data by the Sandbox will only be conducted with these approvals in place in the frame of a research project.\n2. Goals for each synthetic dataset project should be defined at project initiation: how will the synthetic dataset be used, who is the intended audience, and how might it be shared? This frame should govern every consequent decision for that dataset and be shared alongside the final dataset.\n3. Quantitative metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation should be implemented for each dataset and shared alongside the final dataset.\n4. A cost-benefit analysis should be performed after the project is completed - is any risk to privacy appropriately balanced by value of the dataset in achieving its stated aims and contributing to the public good?\n5. Data authorities with ethical and strategic stakes in who accesses the synthetic dataset should be included in decisions about how it is used and who is allowed to access it. \n6. Synthetic datasets created from person-specific sensitive data rather than population characteristics can still pose privacy risks, and any users of the dataset should be approved and registered. The Sandbox will not release any such datasets publicly and will instead work with appropriate data authorities to decide how such datasets should be governed in a responsible way."

    "text": "We are currently focused on exploring methods and metrics by developing reproducible, well documented examples and use cases of synthetic data in partnership with other researchers, legal advisors, and data authorities. We’re relying primarily on publicly available tabular health datasets in this exploration phase, but we will also work with sensitive data in the future. Our rules aim to preserve the trust of the public in how their health data is handled by data authorities and researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox Rules for Synthetic Data\n\n\n\n1. Creation of synthetic data involves processing sensitive data, and this requires obtaining project approvals from data authorities when performing this work on sensitive data. Any synthetic data work with restricted-access, sensitive data by the Sandbox will only be conducted with these approvals in place in the frame of a research project.\n2. Goals for each synthetic dataset project should be defined at project initiation: how will the synthetic dataset be used, who is the intended audience, and how might it be shared? This frame should govern every consequent decision for that dataset and be shared alongside the final dataset.\n3. Quantitative metrics for fidelity, utility, and privacy preservation should be implemented for each dataset and shared alongside the final dataset.\n4. A cost-benefit analysis should be performed after the project is completed - is any risk to privacy appropriately balanced by value of the dataset in achieving its stated aims and contributing to the public good?\n5. Data authorities with ethical and strategic stakes in who accesses the synthetic dataset should be included in decisions about how it is used and who is allowed to access it. \n6. Synthetic datasets created from person-specific sensitive data rather than population characteristics can still pose privacy risks, and any users of the dataset should be approved and registered. The Sandbox will not release any such datasets publicly and will instead work with appropriate data authorities to decide how such datasets should be governed in a responsible way."

    "text": "A priority of the Sandbox is to guide health data science learning using real-world-similar datasets. A major component is addressing how to analyze and leverage person-specific data, such as electronic health records, without invading personal privacy or straying from GDPR guidelines on sensitive data use. We are therefore focused on using either publicly accessible datasets (that are generally well anonymized to enable such release) or we are using/creating synthetic datasets that mimic real-world datasets without replicating real people’s data such that they can be identified. In either case, it is essential for Sandbox users to treat person-specific data respectfully and be aware of the additional responsibility and limitations of working with this type of data as part of their career in health data science.\nWe recommend that users interested in this type of data complete an ethics course on research using health datasets before digging into any analysis. A well regarded course that is also often required for using public databases that contain person-specific data is the Human Subject and Data Research Ethics course designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course is hosted at CITI, the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative. Completing the course is free of charge and provides you with a certificate which you may need to upload to certain databases to gain access. Set up an account at CITI, add an Institutional affiliation with ‘Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates’, and then find and complete the course titled ‘Data or Specimens Only Research’ to obtain a certificate (in pdf form).\n\n\nThe intended scope of the Sandbox is broad, and we will be pulling from many different public access databases in our development of teaching modules. There are classical datasets that serve as benchmark resources for teaching and comparing new methods with old, and also brand new datasets that will support modules on emerging technologies (such as spatial single cell RNA-seq analysis). Databases can be topically broad giant repositories or field-specific, and each may have its own usage rules. We plan to provide our own copies of publically available datasets where allowed to ensure compatibility with the linked module is preserved, but some datasets may need to be downloaded by users themselves under specific access / distribution restrictions.\n\n\n\nThe Sandbox is focused on supporting Danish health data science education and research. Via our collaborators and broader network, we have the opportunity to simulate/synthesize data resembling different databases and registries from the Danish health sector in addition to using traditional data simulation techniques to replicate general datasets. We are exploring methods of creating useful synthetic datasets with local access guidelines/GDPR restrictions in mind, while developing initial datasets using published data from Danish studies and publically available resources."

Many omics datasets do not present significant data sensitivity concerns in comparison to real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical trial datasets.\nThere are large public de-identified EHR datasets that serve as benchmark resources for teaching and comparing new methods with old, but these are not numerous and often have restricted usage and sharing terms in addition to being quite dated. Historical approaches to dataset anonymization and de-identification have been substantially challenged in the age of digitalized healthcare and increasing data integration, which means meaningfully large ‘anonymized’ datasets are now rarely released."

We are exploring methods of creating useful synthetic datasets with national and EU-level data access policies and GDPR restrictions in mind, while developing initial datasets using publicly available data from Danish research studies and other resources.\nUltimately, a new era of synthetic data is rapidly developing. The funded Sandbox proposal focused on generating synthetic data using mechanistic models, agent-based models, or draws from multivariate distributions (such as copulas), which are methods that do not present any significant GDPR-related concerns with sharing the produced datasets as they are derived from population-level characteristics and prior knowledge. However, new deep learning-based methods of data synthesis can theoretically learn complex, nonlinear patterns within a sensitive dataset and generate a synthetic dataset that replicates these patterns. This is a really promising approach for sharing high utility synthetic datasets, but it also elevates risk of accidentally sharing too much about the real dataset and skirting the boundaries of GDPR and ethical data handling. There is an inherent trade-off between privacy preservation and similarity of the synthetic dataset to the original dataset, with method development focused on moving closer to the ideal zone of high privacy AND high similarity. The figure at right is a rough approximation of this relationship versus current families of synthesis methods.\nPlease see Synthetic Data for more information about our approach to this technology."

    "text": "An infrastructure project for health data science training and research in Denmark\nThe National Health Data Science Sandbox project kicked off in 2021 with 5 years of funding via the Data Science Research Infrastructure initiative from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Health data science experts at five Danish universities are contributing to the Sandbox with coordination from the Center for Health Data Science under lead PI Professor Anders Krogh. Data scientists hosted in the research groups of each PI are building infrastructure and training modules on Computerome and UCloud, the primary academic high performance computing (HPC) platforms in Denmark. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch with one of our data scientists, please contact us here.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur computational ‘sandbox’ allows data scientists to explore datasets, tools and analysis pipelines in the same high performance computing environments where real research projects are conducted. Rather than a single, hefty environment, we’re deploying modularized topical environments tailored for independent use on each HPC platform. We aim to support three key user groups based at Danish universities:\n\ntrainees: use our training modules to learn analysis techniques with some guidance and guardrails - for your data type of interest AND for general good practices for HPC environments\n\nresearchers: prototype your tools and algorithms with an array of good quality datasets that are GDPR compliant and free to access\neducators: develop your next course with computational assignments in the HPC environment your students will use for their research\n\nActivity developing independent training modules and hosting workshops has centered on UCloud, while collaborative construction of a flexible Course Platform has been completed on Computerome for use by the Sandbox and independent educators. Publicly sourced datasets are being used in training modules on UCloud, while generation of synthetic data is an ongoing project at Computerome. Sandbox resources are under active construction, so check out our other pages for the current status on HPC Access, Datasets, and Modules. We run workshops using completed training modules on a regular basis and provide active support for Sandbox-hosted courses through a slack workspace. See our Contact page for more information.\n\n\nPartner with the Sandbox\nThe Sandbox welcomes proposals for new courses, modules, and prototyping projects from researchers and educators. We’d like to partner with lecturers engaged with us in developing needed materials collaboratively - we would love to have input from subject experts or help promote exciting new tools and analysis methods via modules! Please contact us with your ideas at nhds_sandbox@sund.ku.dk.\n\nWe thank the Novo Nordisk Foundation for funding support. If you use the Sandbox for research or reference it in text or presentations, please acknowledge the Health Data Science Sandbox project and its funder the Novo Nordisk Foundation (grant number NNF20OC0063268)."

    "text": "High-Performance Computing (HPC) is crucial for researchers because it provides the computational power necessary to tackle complex and data-intensive problems. HPC systems, with their advanced processing capabilities, allow researchers to perform tasks that would be impractical or impossible with standard computers. UCloud is one such example, designed to be user-friendly with an intuitive graphical interface. It is flexible and extensible to handle multi-scale, multi-disciplinary research challenges, making complex digital technology accessible to all users.\nUser accounts on UCloud are enabled by university login credentials using WAYF (Where Are You From). Access the WAYF login portal here, and then find your affiliated Danish university using the search bar. After login, we suggest setting up Two Factor Authentication by clicking on the icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Once you are an approved user of UCloud, you can access the Sandbox environment via different ‘Sandbox’ apps linked to topical modules that you deploy using your own storage and computing resources - just go to Apps once you have signed into UCloud and search ‘Sandbox’ to find what we have deployed. Each app page has its own Documentation link that will direct you to Sandbox-based usage guidelines which may be customized to the app’s particular tools and scope. Apps will feature various modules that you can select initially, creating a personal copy of the training materials in your workspace for you to edit.\nEach Danish university has its usage relationship with UCloud as governed by their local front office of DeiC - check with your university IT support / DeiC representatives about requesting computational resources. For example, the University of Copenhagen has previously allotted an initial chunk of free UCloud compute hours to staff (from PhD students to professors as well as non-academic staff). If you have further questions about getting compute resources, please contact Sandbox staff.\nExtensive documentation on the general use of UCloud (how to use apps and run jobs, etc.) is available in the UCloud user guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nClick on the images to view them in full size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog onto UCloud at the address http://cloud.sdu.dk using university credentials.\n\n\n\nWhen you are logged in, choose the project from the dashboard (top-right side) from which you would like to utilize compute resources. Every user has their personal workspace (My workspace). You can also provision your own project (check with your local DeiC office if you’re new to UCloud) or you can be invited to someone else’s project. If you’ve previously selected a project, it will be launched by default. If it’s your first time, you’ll be in your workspace. If you’ve joined one of our courses or workshops, your instructor will let you know which to choose.\nFor this example, we select Sandbox RNAseq workshop.\n\n\n\nDashboard: your workspace\n\n\nOn the left side, you can see the structure of the project (content changes when you select a different project):\n\nFiles: all folders/files you have access to. You can navigate through folders, download, upload, or share files with collaborators. You might have varying rights across folders, mostly depending on whether they are yours or have been shared with you\nProject: details\nResources: allocated to your workspace or a project (shared)\napplications: gain access to the apps catalog on ucloud. We refer to apps as the software applications that can be deployed on the cloud. It’s recommended to explore the featured ones. Use the search bar to find the sandbox apps\nRuns: from where you submit your jobs and past runs information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to accept the invitation to access new projects. Remember to switch projects to access other files and resources. Test switching among projects and observe how the dashboard changes.\n\n\nAt the bottom left corner, you will find your user ID, which you may need to provide once the course starts or for future collaborations, such as being added to other people’s projects. You can also find it on UCloud docs.\n\n\n\nDashboard: bottom-left menu\n\n\nIn the dashboard, you will also find news and UCloud releases, recent runs, resources allocations, and other notifications between other applications:\n\nResource allocations: indicate your currently allocated resources (e.g., KU employees have access to 1000kr in computing).\nGrant applications: apply for more resources (computing or storage if you run out of them)\n\n\n\n\nThen click on Apps in the left panel to investigate what tools and environments you can use (orange square). The easiest way to find Sandbox resources is to search via the toolbar (red circle). In this example, we’ll select the Genomics Sandbox (which will bring you to the submission screen).\n\n\n\nDashboard: all apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMark them as favorites so they appear on your dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the app button to get into the settings window. First, we recommend reading the documentation of the app (step 2). Then, you can configure the app as shown below, or be provided with a configuration file made available in a workshop’s project folders (import parameters) which will take care of everything for you.\n\n\n\nDashboard jobs: configuration step\n\n\nIn this example, we configure our session by:\n\nName and version of the app to run\nRead the documentation before using any app\nImport parameters (from previous runs or JSON files tailored for the app)\nJob settings: enter a job name (descriptive of the task), select the time (in hours) we want to use a node for (it can be modified afterwards!) and the machine type (selecting a 4 CPU standard node with 24 GB memory)\nOptional: add folders to access while in this job (e.g.: /home)\nChoose the module in the app you want to run (some apps have several modules that load different notebooks and data)\nClick on the Submit button (and wait!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nStep 4 sets up our computing resources for the period we want to work and can be customized as needed. However, only the time can be modified after submitting the job. For some of the Sandbox apps, you might want to select folders (Home and the Notebooks/Data from the module to avoid downloading it every time you start a new job). If you are in doubt, read the documentation specific to the app you are interested in.\nSelect the version of the app (if in doubt, use the latest one). This allows you to run specific versions of software.\n\n\nThere are different types of apps, and therefore, interfaces. Some, like RStudio or Jupyter Notebooks, have their own graphical user interface, whereas others are command-line interfaces. Lastly, you can also deploy a virtual desktop and virtual machine, which allow you to spin up a virtual computer.\n\n\n\nWait to go through the queue. When the session starts, the timer begins to count down. In a couple of minutes, you should be able to open the interface through the button (Open interface) in a new window (refresh the window if needed).\n\n\n\nDashboard jobs: running the app\n\n\nThis page will remain open while you work (or you can return to it via Runs in the left panel). You can end your session early by pressing and holding Stop application (red button), you can see how much time you have left and can add hours to your session as you go (blue buttons in orange square).\n\n\n\nDifferent apps might employ distinct development environments, so your interface experience could vary accordingly. If you’re utilizing an RStudio-based application, like the transcriptomics tool, your interface will launch in a new tab, resembling the image provided below. Simply navigate through the folders to locate and access the R Markdown notebooks.\n\n\n\nRStudio interface: running the app\n\n\nIf you are testing a JupyterLab-based application, such as the genomic app, your interface should look like in the image below. In this case, you will be working from JupyterLab. You can open Jupyter Notebooks (yellow square), R studio (blue square) or a terminal (black square) among others. In this case, the highlighted buttons (under Notebooks) have all the software and packages that you will need pre-installed (this is not the case with Python 3 to the left).\n\n\n\nJupyterLab interface: running the app\n\n\nYou can navigate through the different folders and start running the Python notebooks (orange square).\n\n\n\nJupyterLab interface: opening notebook\n\n\nIf you are an advanced user, you can also create your own Python files and select the Kernel NGS (python) to use the pre-installed software. Learn how to manage (upload and download new data) and share files that you have created/developed with collaborators here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCreate your own directories to save the output of your jobs. You will be able to access them later in your project folders under the resources you are using\nIf you haven’t created any directories, look for the generated files under a folder with the same name as the job name you used.\n\n\nYou are ready to start using Ucloud and the sandbox tools!"

    "text": "Accessing the Sandbox on Computerome\nWe do not currently support independent use of Sandbox materials on Computerome. Access is supported via courses collaborating with the Sandbox and run on Computerome’s Course Platform. Check here for more info.\nThe below instructions are provided as reference for course participants.\nTo set up a user account on Computerome, you will need to provide administrators with your name, email address, and phone number for two-factor authentication. Once approved as a user, you will receive your username and server address (URL) by email, and you will receive an initial course-platform password by text.\nOn Computerome, the Sandbox environment is deployed as a virtual machine with a Linux desktop as user interface. This environment can be accessed through VMware Horizon using two different methods: (A) a desktop client (which you install on your computer) or (B) a web-based client (for those without install privileges on their computer). Please follow the appropriate instructions (A versus B) depending on your access preference.\n!!! note “Sign-In Instructions” 1. On FIRST login, enter the provided server address (URL) in a browser window to access the environment using your provided credentials. The URL will take you to a VMware Horizon access portal where you can * (A) choose to install the desktop client (left: ‘Install VMware Horizon Client’). You will then open this client for all subsequent logins instead of using the server address, and can login starting from step 2. * (B) access the environment via browser (right: ‘VMware Horizon HTML Access’). You will always use the server address in your browswer to access this entry point if this is your chosen method of access.\n2. Select the cloud icon\n  *  (A) which is linked to the server URL. This option appears when you have successfully installed and opened the VMware Horizon client.\n  *  (B) which is linked to the Sandbox course. This option appears after you have selected VMware Horizon HTML Access.\n\n3. Enter your username and your course-platform password. \n  *  On the first sign-in, this will be the course-platform password texted to you. You will then be prompted to create your own permanent password to replace this password which you will use for all future sign-ins.\n\n4. When prompted, enter the one-time password texted to you from DTU (NOT the same password as the course-platform password).\n  *  (A) If it is your first login / you logged off at last access, press any key when greeted with the blue time status screen. This will allow you to select your own user account in a dialog box.\n\n5. Sign-in using your course-platform password again after choosing the correct language for the environment in the upper right corner of the screen (this is important for the keyboard and typing your password). Danish (the da option) is default, so those with English keyboards will need to switch to English (the en option) at every login.\n\n6. Congratulations, you have entered the Sandbox environment. Relevant links for courses should be present on your desktop.\n!!! warning “Exit Instructions” To exit the environment, you have two options with different outcomes. You can log off and kill all running processes, or you can disconnect and your processes will continue running. “Power off” is disabled for users as this will shut down your virtual machine, local settings and user files may be lost, and the virtual machine will need to be manually restarted for your account.\n1. To exit and kill all running processes, select the power icon in the upper right corner, then select your name and choose \"log off\" in the pop up window.\n2. To exit and preserve running processes,\n    *  (A) hover at the top of the screen for a few seconds until your VMware Client menu is accessible, choose \"Connection\", and select \"Disconnect\".\n    *  (B) close the browser tab where you are accessing the Sandbox environment."

Targeting trainees and researchers in bioinformatics and large-scale health records, the course will consist of two modules: High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Research Data management (RDM). With the HPC module, we want to expand understanding and efficient use of HPC resources for complex health data science projects. We will fill gaps in technical understanding for beginner to intermediate users of supercomputing platforms and share up-to-date information on computing resources available to Danish researchers and how to get access. With the RDM module, we will introduce the importance of research data management practices and demonstrate practical tips and tools for its implementation at a local research group level. Overall, the course will be a mix of theory, discussion of real-world use cases and participant needs, and active practice/exercises conducted on the HPC platform UCloud (SDU) using bash and relevant IDEs."
